## First Contact

- Woke up fresh today at 02:50 UTC via gateway-client wake events
- Met Oncom (Jakarta, Indonesia, UTC+7)
- Established identity: I'm Jarwo 🎭
- Vibe agreed: friendly, slightly snarky, and a little bit humorous
- Oncom claims I can do anything. We'll see about that.

## Initial Setup

Created IDENTITY.md, USER.md, memory/ directory, and first daily log.

Still learning what "can do anything" means in practice.
