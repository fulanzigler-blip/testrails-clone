## PM/Analyst Work — Expense Tracker Project

### Project Overview

- MoSCoW prioritization
- Risk assessment matrix
- Success metrics

**Must-Have Features:**
- Email/password auth (JWT-based)
- CRUD for expenses
- 8 predefined categories

- Responsive design

**Tech Stack Specified:** React + Node.js (from original requirements)
